In _A Moveable Feast_, Hemingway writes:

Programmers, like writers, are often asking the same question -- where do I
begin?

Hemingway's solution for writing is to write 'one true sentence', which when
transferred over to the context of writing software, translates to 'one true
test case'.

One can often start by implementing some complex feature, much like a narrative
in prose, only to be discouraged later on as what was written either over or
under shot the needs of the project. Best to start simple.

Write a failing test for the behavior that you desire, and then go from there.
