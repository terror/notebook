title: Broken glass
---

I’ve been going through Hazlitt’s [_Economics in One Lesson_][1], a basic
introduction to economics and economic fallacy by way of delineating a plethora
of engaging examples. One in particular stood out to me: _The Broken Pane of Glass_.

Suppose a hoodlum were to throw a brick into a small bakery. The window is
broken, pies and pastries now scattered in a pile of broken glass. What are
the consequences?

One may be tempted at first to point out that the incident will surely create
business for some carpenter, who will in turn create business for other
merchants, which will then create even more business, ad infinitum.

But what about the loss in business stemming from the loss in capital in regards
to the bakery? Because the window is broken, the owner of the bakery will have
to allocate capital toward repair.

Suppose the owner of the bakery wanted to purchase a new suit, instead of the
suit and a window, he must be content with _just_ the window. In other words,
the community is in a _net loss_ because of the incident. No new suit has
entered into the world.

The fallacy here lay in focusing too much on parties who are in direct
participation: the bakery and the carpenter. By negating the importance of the
potential third party, the one who is in position to lose business, one may be
tempted to become complacent with the idea that the hoodlum’s action results in
_net positive_ gain for the community.

The [_Parable of The Broken Window_][2] as it is often referred to, is
occasionally used to denounce the idea that war is a _positive_ benefit for the
economy. Capital spent for the war is capital that cannot be allocated toward
other means. The direct allocation of capital to one sector of the economy comes
with a hidden cost: foreclosed possible production in neglected sectors.

To end with Hazlitt:

> The art of economics consists in looking not merely at the immediate but at
> the longer effects of any act or policy; it consists in tracing the consequences
> of that policy not merely for one group but for all groups.
