            I’ve been going through Hazlitt’s
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics_in_One_Lesson"
              ><em>Economics in One Lesson</em></a
            >, a basic introduction to economics and economic fallacy by way of
            delineating a plethora of engaging examples. One in particular stood
            out to me: <em>The Broken Pane of Glass</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Suppose a hoodlum were to throw a brick into a small bakery. The
            window is broken, pies and pastries now scattered in a pile of
            broken glass. What are the consequences?
          </p>
          <p>
            One may be tempted at first to point out that the incident will
            surely create business for some carpenter, who will in turn create
            business for other merchants, which will then create even more
            business, ad infinitum.
          </p>
          <p>
            But what about the loss in business stemming from the loss in
            capital in regards to the bakery? Because the window is broken, the
            owner of the bakery will have to allocate capital toward repair.
          </p>
          <p>
            Suppose the owner of the bakery wanted to purchase a new suit,
            instead of the suit and a window, he must be content with
            <em>just</em> the window. In other words, the community is in a
            <em>net loss</em> because of the incident. No new suit has entered
            into the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            The fallacy here lay in focusing too much on parties who are in
            direct participation: the bakery and the carpenter. By negating the
            importance of the potential third party, the one who is in position
            to lose business, one may be tempted to become complacent with the
            idea that the hoodlum’s action results in <em>net positive</em> gain
            for the community.
          </p>
          <p>
            The
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_broken_window"
              ><em>Parable of The Broken Window</em></a
            >
            as it is often referred to, is occasionally used to denounce the
            idea that war is a <em>positive</em> benefit for the economy.
            Capital spent for the war is capital that cannot be allocated toward
            other means. The direct allocation of capital to one sector of the
            economy comes with a hidden cost: foreclosed possible production in
            neglected sectors.
          </p>
          <p>To end with Hazlitt:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              The art of economics consists in looking not merely at the
              immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy; it
              consists in tracing the consequences of that policy not merely for
              one group but for all groups.
            </p>
