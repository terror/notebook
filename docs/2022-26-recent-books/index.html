            I set a rather lofty reading goal at the beginning of this year – 52
            books – a decision that is now starting to signal as untenable
            hubris, considering I am

            Map and Territory - (Eliezer Yudkowsky)
          </h3>
          <p>
            This is the first book in Yudkowsky’s massive tome,
            <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/rationality"
              ><em>Rationality: From AI to Zombies</em></a
            >
            – aka ‘The Sequences’ – which could serve as an introduction to the
            art of rationality, cognitive bias, and Bayesian thinking.
          </p>
          <p>
            The book is pretty dense, however the prose is quite accessible, and
            there are many interesting ideas put forth.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyone interested in learning about a style of thinking that
            systematically gets one closer to holding accurate beliefs about the
            world should read this book.
          </p>
          <h3 id="lying-sam-harris">Lying (Sam Harris)</h3>
          <p>
            A lament against deceitful behaviour. Quite short, nothing too
            mind-blowing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many may intuit that lying is bad, Harris goes so far as to say:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Every lie is an assault on the autonomy of those we lie to.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            He reminds us that a false statement can travel great distances,
            yielding consequences unforeseen at its inception:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              By lying to one person, we potentially spread falsehoods to many
              others—even to whole societies.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            In an iterated
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma"
              >prisoner’s dilemma</a
            >, the optimal strategy is to cooperate, and Harris echoes that
            sentiment with his relationship vs transaction perspective:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              Do you view your life in terms of relationships or transactions?
              If you’re bidding on eBay, truth isn’t an issue. That is a
              completely transactional situation. If I’m dealing with my
              mechanic on an ongoing basis, it’s not a transaction. It’s a
              relationship, and he will make judgments about me and about my
              reliability as a person. And I will make judgments about him, and
              these judgments will have long-term effects for both of us.
            </p>

          <h3 id="outliers-malcolm-gladwell">Outliers (Malcolm Gladwell)</h3>
          <p>
            This book was surprisingly very interesting and enjoyable to read.
            Something about Gladwell’s writing just clicks.
          </p>
          <p>
            The book is about success, in the traditional sense, and what role
            the cards we’re dealt, so to speak – e.g. our environment growing
            up, intelligence, birth month – play in the process of achieving it.
          </p>
          <p>
            It turns out, they play a critical role – as seen in the clustered
            birth months of top hockey players, the cultural heritage of top
            mathematics students, and how Microsoft might owe its inception to a
            high school ‘Mothers Club’.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              We pretend that success is exclusively a matter of individual
              merit. But there’s nothing in any of the histories we’ve looked at
              so far to suggest things are that simple.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Even though this may be the case, merit’s role is far from
            non-existent, and Gladwell sums it up nicely:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              Outliers are those who have been given opportunities—and who have
              had the strength and presence of mind to seize them.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <h3 id="what-does-it-all-mean-thomas-nagel">
            What Does It All Mean? (Thomas Nagel)
          </h3>
          <p>
            Nagel introduces a general audience to the discipline of philosophy,
            using simple language – focusing on life’s big unanswered, yet
            comprehensively addressed, questions.
          </p>
          <p>
            He offers his take on these questions, but that isn’t the primary
            motivation behind his work, it is to get us thinking about these
            questions – so as to confront some of the more dense philosophical
            works with our own worked out ideas in mind:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              Before learning a lot of philosophical theories it is better to
              get puzzled about the philosophical questions which those theories
              try to answer.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            I enjoyed this book thoroughly, and would recommend it to anyone
            whose curious about what philosophy is all about.

          <h3 id="an-illustrated-book-of-bad-arguments-ali-almossawi">
            An Illustrated Book of Bad Arguments (Ali Almossawi)
          </h3>
          <p>
            This was a rather short read, took me about an hour, but very
            interesting nonetheless. As the title may hint, the authors goal is
            to deconstruct and delineate various types of bad arguments used in
            debate and discussion.
          </p>
          <p>
            To give some examples, we encounter the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man"
              ><em>straw man</em></a
            >
            tactic:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              To “put up a straw man” is to intentionally caricature a person’s
              argument with the aim of attacking the caricature rather than the
              actual argument.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            And the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_dilemma"
              ><em>false dilemma</em></a
            >:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              A false dilemma is an argument that presents a limited set of two
              possible categories and assumes that everything in the scope of
              the discussion must be an element of that set.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            And the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_fallacy"
              ><em>genetic fallacy</em></a
            >:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              A genetic fallacy is committed when an argument is either devalued
              or defended solely because of its origins. In fact, an argument’s
              history or the origins of the person making it have no effect
              whatsoever on its validity.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            I would recommend this book to anyone interested in how to construct
            sound arguments – this would serve as a good enough guide on what
            <em>not</em> to do.

            The Man Who Loved Only Numbers (Paul Hoffman)
          </h3>
          <p>
            Hoffman’s work is a biography of the famous mathematician
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Erd%C5%91s"
              >Paul Erdős</a
            >
            (pronounced air-dish), which goes in great depth on Erdős’ comically
            eccentric lifestyle and personality, while not being afraid to
            expose his mathematical work in an accessible and engaging manner.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyone interested in mathematics should read this, you do learn
            quite a few results as Hoffman touches on Erdős’ work in
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number_theorem"
              >number theory</a
            >,
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory"
              >graph theory</a
            >
            and
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsey_theory"
              >ramsey theory</a
            >. But more importantly, you get a glimpse into how mathematicians
            work and collaborate.
